# jetpack.js
A simple vanilla JavaScript library that makes scrolling look outrageously good.

## how to use
Include either `jetpack.js` or `jetpack.min.js` (coming soon) to your document header, and simply add the following lines after your document has loaded:
```javascript
jetpack.setup();
jetpack.hookAnchors();
```
